# Natural-Language-Processing


A project created for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) course is kept in this repository. 
Building a Neural Dependency Parser using a neural network and the BERT model is the project's goal. 
The Arc-Eager method is the dependency parsing strategy used in this project.
